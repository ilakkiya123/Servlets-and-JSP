=>It is provided here to state by the apache tomcat .It is server side storage mechanisms.
=>It allows us to store user specific data on multiple requests.

sendRedirect -> redirects you to the new url mentioned inside the parameter .
In above both sendRedirect tells us to move to the new url ,but session and cookies will continue to work as usual maintaining the state before and after the redirect .
